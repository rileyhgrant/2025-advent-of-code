# 2025-advent-of-code
My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (AoC) 2025 in C

* Note, to set up this repo ahead of the 2025 event, the current files solve problems from [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

## Requirements

- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [clang](https://clang.llvm.org)

## Input

My personal inputs are not included in this repo per [https://adventofcode.com/2025/about](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about).

Currently, the expected location of the inputs are: `./input/dayNN.txt` and `./input/dayNN_test.txt`
e.g. `./input/day02.txt` and `./input/day02_test.txt`

Place your input(s) in that directory, with the same naming convention to have this repo work as-is for your problem inputs.

## Usage

Run `make run` from the command line with an argument for the day you wish to solve, e.g.

```
❯ make run day=1
```

```
